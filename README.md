## 📁 Project Structure


## 🧠 How It Works

- The snake is controlled by the player using arrow keys.
- It moves continuously on the screen and grows longer every time it eats food.
- If the snake collides with itself or the wall, the game ends.
- The score is displayed and updated on the screen during gameplay.
